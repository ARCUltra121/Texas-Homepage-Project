                            <h3>History</h3>
                            <p>Texas's story begins with long-established Indigenous cultures. Spanish explorers arrived, and it became part of New Spain, then Mexico. American settlers grew in number, sparking the Texas Revolution (Alamo, Goliad) and the Republic of Texas (1836-1845). U.S. annexation in 1845 led to the Mexican-American War. Texas then joined the Confederacy during the Civil War before rejoining the Union. The late 19th and 20th centuries saw booms in cattle and oil, shaping its modern economy and distinctive identity.</p>
